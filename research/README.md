Log data was collected with android app that picks up BLE advertisements and
latitude-longitude coordinates. The goal is to collect data from the same
locations at different days/times and then intersect the data to locate
persistant beacon advertisements.

    Walked from 5th and Couch MAX station to 5th and Hall while collecting data.
    Initial impression from data is that signals were picked up from personal
    devices such as phones and bluetooth speakers. Plan to re-walk the same
    route a different day and compare.
